An **inteface** is similar to an abstract class, although it **isn't a class** at all.

It's a **special** type, that's more like a **contract** between the class and client code, that the compiler enforces.

By declaring it's using an interface, your  class must implement all the abstract emthods, on the interface.

A class agrees to this, because it wants to be **known by that type**, by the outside world, or the client code.

An **interface** lets **classes that might have little else in common**, be recognized as a special reference type.
