Build an application that can be a store front for any imaginable item for sale.

Create a **Store** class with a main method. The **Store** class should:
* Manage a **list of products for sale**, including displaying the product details.
* Manage an order which can just be a **list of OrderItem** objects.
* Have methods to **add an item to the order**, and **print the ordered items**, so it looks like a sales receipt.

Create a **ProductForSale** class that should have at least three fields: a **type**, **price**, and a **description**, and should have methods to:
* get a Sales Price, a **concrete method**, which takes a **quantity**, and **returns the quantity times the price**.
* print a Priced Line Item, **a concrete method**, which takes a **quantity**, and should **print an itemized line item** for an order, with **quantity and line item price**.
* show Details, an **abstract method**, which represents what might be **displayed** on a product page, **product type**, **description**, **price**, and so on.

Create an **OrderItem** type, that has at a minimum 2 fields, **quantity** and a **Product for Sale**.

You should create **two or three classes that extend the ProductForSale class**, that will be products in your store.
