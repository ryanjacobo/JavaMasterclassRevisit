Create another inner class called Burger.

This should be a specialized Item, and should also include a list of toppings, also Items.

Remember Items have a name, type, price, and methods to convert prices.

Allow a user to add toppings using the Meal class, which it should then delegate to its burger class.

Allow toppings to be added with a method that allows for a variable number of Strings to be entered, representing the toppings selected.

Allow toppings to be priced differently, some are free, some have an additional cost.

Print the topping out along with the burger information.
